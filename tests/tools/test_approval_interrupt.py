"""Regression: a blocking gateway approval wait must honor an interrupt (#8697).

When an agent calls a dangerous command, the gateway approval flow blocks the
agent's execution thread inside ``_await_gateway_decision`` on
``threading.Event.wait()`` until the user responds or the 5-minute approval
timeout elapses.  Before the fix, ``/stop`` (which calls
``AIAgent.interrupt()`` → per-thread interrupt flag) was silently ignored by
that wait loop, so the session stayed wedged until the timeout fired.

The fix checks ``is_interrupted()`` at the top of the poll loop.  Because the
wait runs on the agent's execution thread — the exact thread
``AIAgent.interrupt()`` flags — the check sees the signal and resolves the
pending approval as ``deny`` so the agent loop unwinds cleanly.
