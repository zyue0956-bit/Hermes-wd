"""Tests for rich-message newline normalization (issue #46070).

When Bot API 10.1 ``sendRichMessage`` is available, slash-command responses
are sent through the rich path with RAW markdown.  Standard Markdown treats
a lone ``\\n`` as a soft line break (renders as whitespace), so multi-line
command output collapses into a single paragraph on Telegram.

``_rich_message_payload`` must normalize single newlines to Markdown hard
breaks (two trailing spaces + ``\\n``) so they render as visible line breaks.
Paragraph breaks (``\\n\\n``) and fenced code blocks must be preserved.

The ``telegram`` package is mocked by ``tests/gateway/conftest.py``, so these
tests construct a real ``TelegramAdapter``.
