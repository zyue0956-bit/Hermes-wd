"""Regression guard for #15421 bug 1 — Slack channel session scoping.

Before this fix, every top-level Slack channel message got a unique
``thread_id`` (the message's own ``ts``) stamped onto its
``MessageSource``.  The gateway session store keys sessions by
``(platform, channel_id, thread_id)``, so each top-level message
spawned a **brand new session** and channel context never accumulated
across messages — even when the operator set ``reply_in_thread: false``
in ``config.yaml`` expecting channel-wide conversation.

The fix: when ``reply_in_thread: false`` is configured, top-level
channel messages now land on ``thread_id = None`` so the session store
groups them under a single channel-scoped session.  Genuine thread
replies (``event.thread_ts != ts``) still scope sessions per thread in
both modes — threading UX is unchanged when the operator actually
asks for it.

These tests drive the real ``SlackAdapter._handle_slack_message`` code
path with mocked aiohttp / user-resolution so the ``MessageEvent``
that reaches ``handle_message`` exposes exactly what the session store
will key on.  Asserting on the event keeps the seam tight against the
production function's behaviour rather than a re-implementation.
