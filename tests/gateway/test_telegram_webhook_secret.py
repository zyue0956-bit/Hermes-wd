"""Tests for GHSA-3vpc-7q5r-276h — Telegram webhook secret required.

Previously, when TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL was set but TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET
was not, python-telegram-bot received secret_token=None and the webhook
endpoint accepted any HTTP POST.

The fix refuses to start the adapter in webhook mode without the secret.
