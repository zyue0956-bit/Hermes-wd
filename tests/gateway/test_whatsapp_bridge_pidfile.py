"""Regression tests: the WhatsApp stale-bridge cleanup must never kill a stranger.

The bridge records its PID in ``bridge.pid``. On the next start the gateway
SIGTERMs that PID to reap an orphaned bridge. The original code checked only
that the PID was *alive* — but once the bridge exits and is reaped the kernel
can recycle its number onto an unrelated process. Because the WhatsApp bridge
crash-loops, this cleanup ran constantly, and a recycled PID that had landed on
the user's browser main process got SIGTERMed, closing the browser at irregular
intervals (no crash, no coredump — a clean kill of a stranger).

These tests prove the identity guard: a PID is only signalled when it is still
our bridge (kernel start time matches, or — for legacy pidfiles — its command
line names node + this session). A recycled PID is left alone.
