# FastMCP

Build MCP servers in Python with FastMCP, validate them locally, install them into MCP clients, and deploy them as HTTP endpoints.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the task is to:

- create a new MCP server in Python
- wrap an API, database, CLI, or file-processing workflow as MCP tools
- expose resources or prompts in addition to tools
- smoke-test a server with the FastMCP CLI before wiring it into Hermes or another client
- install a server into Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or a similar MCP client
- prepare a FastMCP server repo for HTTP deployment

Use `native-mcp` when the server already exists and only needs to be connected to Hermes. Use `mcporter` when the goal is ad-hoc CLI access to an existing MCP server instead of building one.

## Prerequisites

Install FastMCP in the working environment first:

```bash
pip install fastmcp
fastmcp version
```

For the API template, install `httpx` if it is not already present:

```bash
pip install httpx
```

## Included Files

### Templates

- `templates/api_wrapper.py` - REST API wrapper with auth header support
- `templates/database_server.py` - read-only SQLite query server
- `templates/file_processor.py` - text-file inspection and search server

### Scripts

- `scripts/scaffold_fastmcp.py` - copy a starter template and replace the server name placeholder

### References

- `references/fastmcp-cli.md` - FastMCP CLI workflow, installation targets, and deployment checks

## Workflow

### 1. Pick the Smallest Viable Server Shape

Choose the narrowest useful surface area first:

- API wrapper: start with 1-3 high-value endpoints, not the whole API
- database server: expose read-only introspection and a constrained query path
- file processor: expose deterministic operations with explicit path arguments
- prompts/resources: add only when the client needs reusable prompt templates or discoverable documents

Prefer a thin server with good names, docstrings, and schemas over a large server with vague tools.

### 2. Scaffold from a Template

Copy a template directly or use the scaffold helper:

```bash
python ~/.hermes/skills/mcp/fastmcp/scripts/scaffold_fastmcp.py \
  --template api_wrapper \
  --name "Acme API" \
  --output ./acme_server.py
```

Available templates:

```bash
python ~/.hermes/skills/mcp/fastmcp/scripts/scaffold_fastmcp.py --list
```

If copying manually, replace `__SERVER_NAME__` with a real server name.

### 3. Implement Tools First

Start with `@mcp.tool` functions before adding resources or prompts.

Rules for tool design:

- Give every tool a concrete verb-based name
- Write docstrings as user-facing tool descriptions
- Keep parameters explicit and typed
- Return structured JSON-safe data where possible
- Validate unsafe inputs early
- Prefer read-only behavior by default for first versions

Good tool examples:

- `get_customer`
- `search_tickets`
- `describe_table`
- `summarize_text_file`

Weak tool examples:

- `run`
- `process`
- `do_thing`

### 4. Add Resources and Prompts Only When They Help

Add `@mcp.resource` when the client benefits from fetching stable read-only content such as schemas, policy docs, or generated reports.

Add `@mcp.prompt` when the server should provide a reusable prompt template for a known workflow.

Do not turn every document into a prompt. Prefer:

- tools for actions
- resources for data/document retrieval
- prompts for reusable LLM instructions

### 5. Test the Server Before Integrating It Anywhere

Use the FastMCP CLI for local validation:

```bash
fastmcp inspect acme_server.py:mcp
fastmcp list acme_server.py --json
fastmcp call acme_server.py search_resources query=router limit=5 --json
```

For fast iterative debugging, run the server locally:

```bash
fastmcp run acme_server.py:mcp
```

To test HTTP transport locally:

```bash
fastmcp run acme_server.py:mcp --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
fastmcp list http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp --json
fastmcp call http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp search_resources query=router --json
```

Always run at least one real `fastmcp call` against each new tool before claiming the server works.

### 6. Install into a Client When Local Validation Passes

FastMCP can register the server with supported MCP clients:

```bash
fastmcp install claude-code acme_server.py
fastmcp install claude-desktop acme_server.py
fastmcp install cursor acme_server.py -e .
```

Use `fastmcp discover` to inspect named MCP servers already configured on the machine.

When the goal is Hermes integration, either:

- configure the server in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` using the `native-mcp` skill, or
- keep using FastMCP CLI commands during development until the interface stabilizes

### 7. Deploy After the Local Contract Is Stable

For managed hosting, Prefect Horizon is the path FastMCP documents most directly. Before deployment:

```bash
fastmcp inspect acme_server.py:mcp
```

Make sure the repo contains:

- a Python file with the FastMCP server object
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- any environment-variable documentation needed for deployment

For generic HTTP hosting, validate the HTTP transport locally first, then deploy on any Python-compatible platform that can expose the server port.

## Common Patterns

### API Wrapper Pattern

Use when exposing a REST or HTTP API as MCP tools.

Recommended first slice:

- one read path
- one list/search path
- optional health check

Implementation notes:

- keep auth in environment variables, not hardcoded
- centralize request logic in one helper
- surface API errors with concise context
- normalize inconsistent upstream payloads before returning them

Start from `templates/api_wrapper.py`.

### Database Pattern

Use when exposing safe query and inspection capabilities.

Recommended first slice:

- `list_tables`
- `describe_table`
- one constrained read query tool

Implementation notes:

- default to read-only DB access
- reject non-`SELECT` SQL in early versions
- limit row counts
- return rows plus column names

Start from `templates/database_server.py`.

### File Processor Pattern

Use when the server needs to inspect or transform files on demand.

Recommended first slice:

- summarize file contents
- search within files
- extract deterministic metadata

Implementation notes:

- accept explicit file paths
- check for missing files and encoding failures
- cap previews and result counts
- avoid shelling out unless a specific external tool is required

Start from `templates/file_processor.py`.

## Quality Bar

Before handing off a FastMCP server, verify all of the following:

- server imports cleanly
- `fastmcp inspect <file.py:mcp>` succeeds
- `fastmcp list <server spec> --json` succeeds
- every new tool has at least one real `fastmcp call`
- environment variables are documented
- the tool surface is small enough to understand without guesswork

## Troubleshooting

### FastMCP command missing

Install the package in the active environment:

```bash
pip install fastmcp
fastmcp version
```

### `fastmcp inspect` fails

Check that:

- the file imports without side effects that crash
- the FastMCP instance is named correctly in `<file.py:object>`
- optional dependencies from the template are installed

### Tool works in Python but not through CLI

Run:

```bash
fastmcp list server.py --json
fastmcp call server.py your_tool_name --json
```

This usually exposes naming mismatches, missing required arguments, or non-serializable return values.

### Hermes cannot see the deployed server

The server-building part may be correct while the Hermes config is not. Load the `native-mcp` skill and configure the server in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, then restart Hermes.
