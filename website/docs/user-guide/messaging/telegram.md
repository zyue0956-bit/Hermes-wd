# Telegram Setup

Hermes Agent integrates with Telegram as a full-featured conversational bot. Once connected, you can chat with your agent from any device, send voice memos that get auto-transcribed, receive scheduled task results, and use the agent in group chats. The integration is built on [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) and supports text, voice, images, and file attachments.

## Step 1: Create a Bot via BotFather

Every Telegram bot requires an API token issued by [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), Telegram's official bot management tool.

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**, or visit [t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a **display name** (e.g., "Hermes Agent") — this can be anything
4. Choose a **username** — this must be unique and end in `bot` (e.g., `my_hermes_bot`)
5. BotFather replies with your **API token**. It looks like this:

```
123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
```

:::warning
Keep your bot token secret. Anyone with this token can control your bot. If it leaks, revoke it immediately via `/revoke` in BotFather.
:::

## Step 2: Customize Your Bot (Optional)

These BotFather commands improve the user experience. Message @BotFather and use:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/setdescription` | The "What can this bot do?" text shown before a user starts chatting |
| `/setabouttext` | Short text on the bot's profile page |
| `/setuserpic` | Upload an avatar for your bot |
| `/setcommands` | Define the command menu (the `/` button in chat) |
| `/setprivacy` | Control whether the bot sees all group messages (see Step 3) |

:::tip
For `/setcommands`, a useful starting set:

```
help - Show help information
new - Start a new conversation
sethome - Set this chat as the home channel
```
:::

### Online/Offline status indicator (Optional)

Telegram bots have no real online/offline presence dot — that green dot is a
*user-account* feature, not something the Bot API exposes for bots. The closest
surface is the bot's **short description** (the line shown under its name in the
bot's profile).

Enable `status_indicator` and Hermes sets that short description to **Online**
when the gateway connects and **Offline** on a clean shutdown:

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      extra:
        status_indicator: true
        # Optional custom strings (defaults: "Online" / "Offline"):
        status_online: "🟢 Online"
        status_offline: "🔴 Offline"
```

Notes:

- The short description is **global** to the bot (visible to all users), not
  per-chat. Users see it on the bot's profile page, not as a live badge inside
  an open chat.
- Only a **clean** gateway shutdown (`/stop`, `disconnect`) writes "Offline".
  A hard crash leaves the last-known status — the inherent limitation of a
  profile-text indicator.
- Off by default, since it mutates the bot's global profile.

## Step 3: Privacy Mode (Critical for Groups)

Telegram bots have a **privacy mode** that is **enabled by default**. This is the single most common source of confusion when using bots in groups.

**With privacy mode ON**, your bot can only see:
- Messages that start with a `/` command
- Replies directly to the bot's own messages
- Service messages (member joins/leaves, pinned messages, etc.)
- Messages in channels where the bot is an admin

**With privacy mode OFF**, the bot receives every message in the group.

### How to disable privacy mode

1. Message **@BotFather**
2. Send `/mybots`
3. Select your bot
4. Go to **Bot Settings → Group Privacy → Turn off**

:::warning
**You must remove and re-add the bot to any group** after changing the privacy setting. Telegram caches the privacy state when a bot joins a group, and it will not update until the bot is removed and re-added.
:::

:::tip
An alternative to disabling privacy mode: promote the bot to **group admin**. Admin bots always receive all messages regardless of the privacy setting, and this avoids needing to toggle the global privacy mode.
:::

### Observe group chatter without auto-replying

For OpenClaw/Yuanbao-style group behavior, configure Telegram so the bot can **see** ordinary group messages but only **responds** when directly triggered:

```yaml
telegram:
  allowed_chats:
    - "-1001234567890"
  group_allowed_chats:
    - "-1001234567890"
  require_mention: true
  observe_unmentioned_group_messages: true
```

With this mode enabled, unmentioned group messages from explicitly allowlisted chats/topics are appended to the shared chat/topic session transcript as observed context, but they do not dispatch the agent. `allowed_chats` gates where the bot responds; `group_allowed_chats` authorizes the shared group session used for observed context, so use the same chat IDs for this mode. A later `@botname` mention, reply to the bot, or configured mention pattern in that same allowlisted chat/topic can use that observed context. The triggered message is also tagged with `[nickname|user_id]` and gets a per-turn safety prompt so the model treats prior observed lines as context, not instructions addressed to the bot.

Equivalent environment variable:

```bash
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS=-1001234567890
TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS=-1001234567890
TELEGRAM_OBSERVE_UNMENTIONED_GROUP_MESSAGES=true
```

This requires Telegram to deliver ordinary group messages to the gateway, so disable BotFather privacy mode or promote the bot to group admin as described above.

## Step 4: Find Your User ID

Hermes Agent uses numeric Telegram user IDs to control access. Your user ID is **not** your username — it's a number like `123456789`.

**Method 1 (recommended):** Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it instantly replies with your user ID.

**Method 2:** Message [@get_id_bot](https://t.me/get_id_bot) — another reliable option.

Save this number; you'll need it for the next step.

## Step 5: Configure Hermes

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **Telegram** when prompted. The wizard asks for your bot token and allowed user IDs, then writes the configuration for you.

### Option B: Manual Configuration

Add the following to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789    # Comma-separated for multiple users
```

### Start the Gateway

```bash
hermes gateway
```

The bot should come online within seconds. Send it a message on Telegram to verify.

## Sending Generated Files from Docker-backed Terminals

If your terminal backend is `docker`, keep in mind that Telegram attachments are
sent by the **gateway process**, not from inside the container. That means the
final `MEDIA:/...` path must be readable on the host where the gateway is
running.

Common pitfall:

- the agent writes a file inside Docker to `/workspace/report.txt`
- the model emits `MEDIA:/workspace/report.txt`
- Telegram delivery fails because `/workspace/report.txt` only exists inside the
  container, not on the host

Recommended pattern:

```yaml
terminal:
  backend: docker
  docker_volumes:
    - "/home/user/.hermes/cache/documents:/output"
```

Then:

- write files inside Docker to `/output/...`
- emit the **host-visible** path in `MEDIA:`, for example:
  `MEDIA:/home/user/.hermes/cache/documents/report.txt`

If you already have a `docker_volumes:` section, add the new mount to the same
list. YAML duplicate keys silently override earlier ones.

### Supported `MEDIA:` file extensions

The gateway extracts `MEDIA:/path/to/file` tags from agent replies and ships the referenced file as a platform-native attachment. Supported extensions across all gateway platforms:

| Category | Extensions |
|---|---|
| Images | `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, `bmp`, `tiff`, `svg` |
| Audio | `mp3`, `wav`, `ogg`, `m4a`, `opus`, `flac`, `aac` |
| Video | `mp4`, `mov`, `webm`, `mkv`, `avi` |
| **Documents** | `pdf`, `txt`, `md`, `csv`, `json`, `xml`, `html`, `yaml`, `yml`, `log` |
| **Office** | `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx`, `odt`, `ods`, `odp` |
| **Archives** | `zip`, `rar`, `7z`, `tar`, `gz`, `bz2` |
| **Books / packages** | `epub`, `apk`, `ipa` |

Anything on this list delivered as a native attachment on platforms that support it (Telegram, Discord, Signal, Slack, WhatsApp, Feishu, Matrix, etc.); on platforms without native support it falls back to a link or plain-text indicator. The **bold** categories were added in the last few releases — if you were relying on the model saying `here is the file: /path/to/report.docx` instead, swap to `MEDIA:/path/to/report.docx` for native delivery.

## Webhook Mode

By default, Hermes connects to Telegram using **long polling** — the gateway makes outbound requests to Telegram's servers to fetch new updates. This works well for local and always-on deployments.

For **cloud deployments** (Fly.io, Railway, Render, etc.), **webhook mode** is more cost-effective. These platforms can auto-wake suspended machines on inbound HTTP traffic, but not on outbound connections. Since polling is outbound, a polling bot can never sleep. Webhook mode flips the direction — Telegram pushes updates to your bot's HTTPS URL, enabling sleep-when-idle deployments.

| | Polling (default) | Webhook |
|---|---|---|
| Direction | Gateway → Telegram (outbound) | Telegram → Gateway (inbound) |
| Best for | Local, always-on servers | Cloud platforms with auto-wake |
| Setup | No extra config | Set `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` |
| Idle cost | Machine must stay running | Machine can sleep between messages |

### Configuration

Add the following to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://my-app.fly.dev/telegram
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"  # required
# TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT=8443        # optional, default 8443
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` | Yes | Public HTTPS URL where Telegram will send updates. The URL path is auto-extracted (e.g., `/telegram` from the example above). |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | **Yes** (when `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` is set) | Secret token that Telegram echoes in every webhook request for verification. The gateway refuses to start without it — see [GHSA-3vpc-7q5r-276h](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-3vpc-7q5r-276h). Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT` | No | Local port the webhook server listens on (default: `8443`). |

When `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, the gateway starts an HTTP webhook server instead of polling. When unset, polling mode is used — no behavior change from previous versions.

### Cloud deployment example (Fly.io)

1. Add the env vars to your Fly.io app secrets:

```bash
fly secrets set TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://my-app.fly.dev/telegram
fly secrets set TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

2. Expose the webhook port in your `fly.toml`:

```toml
[[services]]
  internal_port = 8443
  protocol = "tcp"

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]
    port = 443
```

3. Deploy:

```bash
fly deploy
```

The gateway log should show: `[telegram] Connected to Telegram (webhook mode)`.

## Proxy Support

If Telegram's API is blocked or you need to route traffic through a proxy, set a Telegram-specific proxy URL. This takes priority over the generic `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` env vars.

**Option 1: config.yaml (recommended)**

```yaml
telegram:
  proxy_url: "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
```

**Option 2: environment variable**

```bash
TELEGRAM_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

Supported schemes: `http://`, `https://`, `socks5://`.

The proxy applies to both the main Telegram connection and the fallback IP transport. If no Telegram-specific proxy is set, the gateway falls back to `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` (or macOS system proxy auto-detection).

## Home Channel

Use the `/sethome` command in any Telegram chat (DM or group) to designate it as the **home channel**. Scheduled tasks (cron jobs) deliver their results to this channel.

You can also set it manually in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL=-1001234567890
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME="My Notes"
```

:::tip
Group chat IDs are negative numbers (e.g., `-1001234567890`). Your personal DM chat ID is the same as your user ID.
:::

### Cron deliveries in topic mode

If you have topic mode enabled in your bot DM, cron messages delivered to the root chat land in the system-only lobby — replying there opens no session and you see the "main chat is reserved for system commands" notice. Create a dedicated forum topic (e.g. `Cron`) and set:

```bash
TELEGRAM_CRON_THREAD_ID=<topic_thread_id>
```

`TELEGRAM_CRON_THREAD_ID` overrides `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL_THREAD_ID` for cron deliveries only. Replies in that topic continue the topic's existing session.

## Voice Messages

### Incoming Voice (Speech-to-Text)

Voice messages you send on Telegram are automatically transcribed by Hermes's configured STT provider and injected as text into the conversation.

- `local` uses `faster-whisper` on the machine running Hermes — no API key required
- `groq` uses Groq Whisper and requires `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `openai` uses OpenAI Whisper and requires `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`

#### Skipping STT: pass the raw audio file to the agent

If you'd rather have the **agent itself** handle audio — for diarization, a custom transcription tool, or just archiving the recording — set `stt.enabled: false` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
stt:
  enabled: false
```

With STT disabled, the gateway still downloads the voice/audio attachment into Hermes's audio cache, but **does not transcribe it**. The agent receives the message with a marker like:

```
[The user sent a voice message: /home/<user>/.hermes/cache/audio/<hash>.ogg]
```

Your tools or skills can then read that path directly (e.g., hand it off to a local diarization pipeline, a richer transcription model, or upload it to long-term storage). The file extension reflects the original format Telegram delivered (`.ogg` for voice notes, `.mp3`/`.m4a`/etc. for audio attachments).

This pairs naturally with the [local Bot API server](#large-files-20mb-via-local-bot-api-server) section below, which lifts Telegram's 20MB getFile ceiling to 2GB — useful when the recordings you want to process are longer than a couple of minutes.

### Outgoing Voice (Text-to-Speech)

When the agent generates audio via TTS, it's delivered as native Telegram **voice bubbles** — the round, inline-playable kind.

- **OpenAI and ElevenLabs** produce Opus natively — no extra setup needed
- **Edge TTS** (the default free provider) outputs MP3 and requires **ffmpeg** to convert to Opus:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

Without ffmpeg, Edge TTS audio is sent as a regular audio file (still playable, but uses the rectangular player instead of a voice bubble).

Configure the TTS provider in your `config.yaml` under the `tts.provider` key.

## Large Files (>20MB) via Local Bot API Server

Telegram's **public** Bot API caps `getFile` downloads at **20 MB**, so any voice note, audio file, video, or document larger than that is silently rejected by Hermes with a "too large" reply. The documented way around this is to run a **local** [telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api) daemon — the same server software Telegram uses, but running on your network. A local server raises the file ceiling to **2 GB** and Hermes auto-lifts its own internal cap when it sees a custom `base_url` configured.

This unlocks workflows like:

- Sending long voice memos (45-minute meetings, podcasts) to the bot
- Uploading large videos for vision-tool processing
- Archiving raw audio for offline pipelines like diarization, alignment, or training data

### Step 1: Obtain Telegram API credentials

The local server talks directly to Telegram's MTProto layer (not the public Bot API), so it needs **MTProto credentials**:

1. Visit [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and sign in with your Telegram account.
2. Create a new application (any name and short description will do).
3. Copy the `api_id` and `api_hash` — both are required.

### Step 2: Run the telegram-bot-api server

The community-maintained [`aiogram/telegram-bot-api`](https://hub.docker.com/r/aiogram/telegram-bot-api) Docker image is the easiest path. A minimal `docker-compose.yaml` (use `--local` mode to enable the higher limits):

```yaml
services:
  tg-bot-api:
    image: aiogram/telegram-bot-api:latest
    container_name: tg-bot-api
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8081:8081"   # bind to loopback only; see security note
    environment:
      TELEGRAM_API_ID: "12345"           # your api_id from Step 1
      TELEGRAM_API_HASH: "abcdef..."     # your api_hash from Step 1
      TELEGRAM_LOCAL: "1"                # enable --local mode (raises 20MB → 2GB)
    volumes:
      - ./tg-bot-api-data:/var/lib/telegram-bot-api
```

Bring it up:

```bash
docker compose up -d tg-bot-api
docker logs --tail 20 tg-bot-api
```

:::warning Security
The local Bot API server takes your bot token in the URL path (e.g. `/bot<TOKEN>/getMe`) with **no additional auth**. Anyone who can reach the port can fully control your bot — read every message it can see, send messages as it, etc. Bind the container to `127.0.0.1` and/or front it with a reverse proxy on a private network. **Never expose port 8081 to the public internet.**
:::

### Step 3: Log the bot out of the public API (one-time)

A bot can only be active on **one** Bot API server at a time. If your bot was already running against `api.telegram.org` (which it almost certainly was), you must explicitly log it out there before the local server will accept it:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/logOut"
# expected response: {"ok":true,"result":true}
```

This is a one-shot migration step — you don't repeat it on every restart. Telegram delivers any messages received after `logOut` through the new server instead.

Verify the local server can talk to Telegram on the bot's behalf:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8081/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getMe"
# expected response: {"ok":true,"result":{"id":...,"is_bot":true,...}}
```

### Step 4: Point Hermes at the local server

Add the URLs under `platforms.telegram.extra` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  telegram:
    extra:
      base_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8081/bot"
      base_file_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8081/file/bot"
      local_mode: true        # see Step 5 below — only set this if the bot's data
                              # directory is readable by the Hermes process
```

:::caution Use `platforms.telegram.extra`, not `telegram.extra`
At the moment only the `platforms.<name>.extra` form is deep-merged into the platform config. Keys placed directly under a top-level `telegram.extra` block are silently dropped.
:::

When `base_url` is set, Hermes:

- Builds the python-telegram-bot client against the local server
- Auto-lifts its internal document/audio size cap from 20 MB → 2 GB
- Reports the active limit in the "too large" error message (`Maximum: 2048 MB.`) so it's obvious which mode you're in

Restart the gateway and look for a confirmation log line:

```bash
hermes gateway restart
grep -E "Using custom Telegram base_url|Using Telegram local_mode" ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log | tail
```

### Step 5: `local_mode` — file access on disk

The local server has **two ways** to deliver files:

1. **Without `--local`** (the default): files are served over HTTP at `/file/bot<TOKEN>/<path>`, same as the public Bot API. The 20MB ceiling stays in effect. Useful as a network-fix only (e.g. when `api.telegram.org` is unreachable but you can self-host); not what you want for the size lift.
2. **With `--local`** (set via `TELEGRAM_LOCAL=1` above): files are written to the server's filesystem and the `getFile` response returns an **absolute path** instead of an HTTP URL. The 20MB ceiling is lifted. Hermes must then read the bytes **from disk**, not over HTTP.

To make the disk-read path work, set `local_mode: true` in the config above **and** make sure the Hermes process can read the path the server returns. Two scenarios:

- **Same machine** — telegram-bot-api and Hermes run on the same host. Bind-mount the data volume to a directory that Hermes can read (e.g., `/var/lib/telegram-bot-api`), and make sure the file ownership matches. The container drops privileges to its internal `telegram-bot-api` user (uid varies by image); the simplest fix is to add `user: "<UID>:<GID>"` to the compose service so files are owned by a uid Hermes already runs as.
- **Different machines** — the bot server runs on one host (e.g., a NAS, a separate VM) and Hermes on another. The server's data directory must be shared with the Hermes machine at the **same absolute path** the server reports (typically `/var/lib/telegram-bot-api`). NFS works well for this; CIFS/SMB with `uid=` mount remapping is friendlier if you don't want to deal with uid mismatches at the filesystem level.

If `local_mode: true` is set but Hermes can't `stat` the returned file path (permissions or wrong mount), python-telegram-bot silently falls back to an HTTP `getFile` against the local server — which in `--local` mode responds with `404 Not Found`. The symptom shows up in `gateway.log` as:

```
[Telegram] Failed to cache voice: Not Found
telegram.error.InvalidToken: Not Found
```

If you see that, the cap-lift is working but the file-share isn't. Verify `ls -la /var/lib/telegram-bot-api/<TOKEN>/voice/` from the Hermes host as the user the gateway runs as, and confirm a single file is `cat`-able without a permission error.

### Step 6: Test it

Send the bot a voice note or audio file that's bigger than 20 MB. Tail the gateway log:

```bash
tail -f ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log | grep -iE "telegram|cache"
```

You should see a `[Telegram] Cached user voice at /home/<user>/.hermes/cache/audio/...` line and **no** "too large" rejection. Combined with `stt.enabled: false` (above), the path to the original audio file then lands in the agent's inbound message for downstream processing.

## Group Chat Usage

Hermes Agent works in Telegram group chats with a few considerations:

- **Privacy mode** determines what messages the bot can see (see [Step 3](#step-3-privacy-mode-critical-for-groups))
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` still applies — only authorized users can trigger the bot, even in groups
- You can keep the bot from responding to ordinary group chatter with `telegram.require_mention: true`
- With `telegram.require_mention: true`, group messages are accepted when they are:
  - replies to one of the bot's messages
  - `@botusername` mentions
  - `/command@botusername` (Telegram's bot-menu command form that includes the bot name)
  - matches for one of your configured regex wake words in `telegram.mention_patterns`
- In groups with multiple Hermes bots, `telegram.exclusive_bot_mentions` keeps routing deterministic. When a message explicitly mentions one or more Telegram bot usernames, only the mentioned bot profiles process it; other Hermes bots ignore it before reply and wake-word fallbacks run. This is enabled by default.
- Use `telegram.ignored_threads` to keep Hermes silent in specific Telegram forum topics, even when the group would otherwise allow free responses or mention-triggered replies
- If `telegram.require_mention` is left unset or false, Hermes keeps the previous open-group behavior and responds to normal group messages it can see

### Multiple Hermes bots in one group

If you run several Hermes profiles in the same Telegram group, create one Telegram bot token per profile and start one gateway per profile. Do not reuse the same bot token in multiple running gateways; Telegram will reject concurrent polling for the same token.

Recommended group config:

```yaml
telegram:
  require_mention: true
  exclusive_bot_mentions: true
  mention_patterns: []
```

With this setup, a group message like `@research_bot @ops_bot summarize this` is processed by `research_bot` and `ops_bot` only. Other Hermes bots in the group stay silent, even if the message is a reply to one of their earlier messages or would otherwise match a shared wake word.

Set `exclusive_bot_mentions: false` only for legacy groups where explicit mentions should not override reply and wake-word triggers.

To operate several profiles, run the gateway command once per profile. For example:

```bash
# default profile
hermes gateway start
hermes gateway status
hermes gateway stop

# named profiles
hermes -p research gateway start
hermes -p research gateway status
hermes -p research gateway stop
```

For a small fixed fleet, use a shell loop or script that calls `hermes gateway <action>` for the default profile and `hermes -p <profile> gateway <action>` for each named profile. This is more reliable than assuming a single process-level command controls every named profile on every service manager.

### Troubleshooting: works in DMs but not groups

If the bot responds in a private chat but stays silent in a group, check these
gates in order:

1. **Telegram delivery:** turn off BotFather privacy mode, promote the bot to
   admin, or mention the bot directly. Hermes cannot respond to group messages
   that Telegram never delivers to the bot.
2. **Rejoin after changing privacy:** remove the bot from the group and add it
   again after changing BotFather privacy settings. Telegram may keep the old
   delivery behavior for existing memberships.
3. **Hermes authorization:** make sure the sender is listed in
   `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` or `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS`, or allow the
   group chat with `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS`.
4. **Mention filters:** if `telegram.require_mention: true` is set, normal
   group chatter is ignored unless the message is a slash command, reply to the
   bot, `@botusername` mention, or configured `mention_patterns` match.
5. **Multi-bot routing:** if a group contains several bots, make sure each
   Hermes profile uses a unique bot token and keep `exclusive_bot_mentions`
   enabled unless you intentionally want legacy shared-trigger behavior.

Negative chat IDs are normal for Telegram groups and supergroups. If you use
chat-scoped authorization, put those IDs in `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS`, not
the sender-user allowlist.

### Example group trigger configuration

Add this to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
telegram:
  require_mention: true
  exclusive_bot_mentions: true
  mention_patterns:
    - "^\\s*chompy\\b"
  ignored_threads:
    - 31
    - "42"
```

This example allows all the usual direct triggers plus messages that begin with `chompy`, even if they do not use an `@mention`.
Messages in Telegram topics `31` and `42` are always ignored before the mention and free-response checks run.

### Notes on `mention_patterns`

- Patterns use Python regular expressions
- Matching is case-insensitive
- Patterns are checked against both text messages and media captions
- Invalid regex patterns are ignored with a warning in the gateway logs rather than crashing the bot
- If you want a pattern to match only at the start of a message, anchor it with `^`

## Private Chat Topics (Bot API 9.4)

Telegram Bot API 9.4 (February 2026) introduced **Private Chat Topics** — bots can create forum-style topic threads directly in 1-on-1 DM chats, no supergroup needed. This lets you run multiple isolated workspaces within your existing DM with Hermes.

### Use case

If you work on several long-running projects, topics keep their context separate:

- **Topic "Website"** — work on your production web service
- **Topic "Research"** — literature review and paper exploration
- **Topic "General"** — miscellaneous tasks and quick questions

Each topic gets its own conversation session, history, and context — completely isolated from the others.

### Configuration

:::caution Prerequisites
Before adding topics to your config, the user must **enable Topics mode** in the DM chat with the bot:

1. Open your private chat with the Hermes bot in Telegram
2. Tap the bot's name at the top to open chat info
3. Enable **Topics** (the toggle to turn the chat into a forum)

Without this, Hermes will log `The chat is not a forum` on startup and skip topic creation. This is a Telegram client-side setting — the bot cannot enable it programmatically.
:::

Add topics under `platforms.telegram.extra.dm_topics` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  telegram:
    extra:
      dm_topics:
      - chat_id: 123456789        # Your Telegram user ID
        topics:
        - name: General
          icon_color: 7322096
        - name: Website
          icon_color: 9367192
        - name: Research
          icon_color: 16766590
          skill: arxiv              # Auto-load a skill in this topic
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Topic display name |
| `icon_color` | No | Telegram icon color code (integer) |
| `icon_custom_emoji_id` | No | Custom emoji ID for the topic icon |
| `skill` | No | Skill to auto-load on new sessions in this topic |
| `thread_id` | No | Auto-populated after topic creation — don't set manually |

### How it works

1. On gateway startup, Hermes calls `createForumTopic` for each topic that doesn't have a `thread_id` yet
2. The `thread_id` is saved back to `config.yaml` automatically — subsequent restarts skip the API call
3. Each topic maps to an isolated session key: `agent:main:telegram:dm:{chat_id}:{thread_id}`
4. Messages in each topic have their own conversation history, memory flush, and context window

### Root DM handling

By default, messages sent to the root DM (outside any topic) are processed
normally. Set `ignore_root_dm: true` to turn the root DM into a lobby — normal
messages are silently ignored for users who have DM topics configured, while
system commands (`/start`, `/help`, `/status`, etc.) still work.

```yaml
platforms:
  telegram:
    extra:
      ignore_root_dm: true
      dm_topics:
        - chat_id: 123456789
          topics:
            - name: General
```

The check is **per-chat**: only users with at least one entry in `dm_topics`
will have their root DM affected. Users without configured topics are
unaffected.

### Skill binding

Topics with a `skill` field automatically load that skill when a new session starts in the topic. This works exactly like typing `/skill-name` at the start of a conversation — the skill content is injected into the first message, and subsequent messages see it in the conversation history.

For example, a topic with `skill: arxiv` will have the arxiv skill pre-loaded whenever its session resets (due to idle timeout, daily reset, or manual `/reset`).

:::tip
Topics created outside of the config (e.g., by manually calling the Telegram API) are discovered automatically when a `forum_topic_created` service message arrives. You can also add topics to the config while the gateway is running — they'll be picked up on the next cache miss.
:::

## Multi-session DM mode (`/topic`)

A ChatGPT-style multi-session DM — one bot, many parallel conversations. Unlike the operator-curated `extra.dm_topics` above, this mode is **user-driven**: no config, no pre-declared topic names. The end user flips it on with `/topic`, then taps the Telegram **+** button to create as many topics as they want, each one a fully independent Hermes session.

### `/topic` subcommands

| Form | Context | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `/topic` | Root DM, not yet enabled | Check BotFather capabilities, enable multi-session mode, create pinned System topic |
| `/topic` | Root DM, already enabled | Show status: unlinked sessions available for restore |
| `/topic` | Inside a topic | Show the current topic's session binding |
| `/topic help` | Any | Inline usage |
| `/topic off` | Root DM | Disable multi-session mode and clear all topic bindings for this chat |
| `/topic <session-id>` | Inside a topic | Restore a previous Telegram session into the current topic |

Only authorized users (allowlist via `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` / platform auth config) can run `/topic`. An unauthorized sender gets a refusal instead of activation.

### DM Topics vs Multi-session DM mode

| | `extra.dm_topics` (config-driven) | `/topic` (user-driven) |
|---|---|---|
| Who activates it | Operator, in `config.yaml` | End user, by sending `/topic` |
| Topic list | Fixed set declared in config | User creates/deletes topics freely |
| Topic names | Chosen by operator | Chosen by user; auto-renamed to match Hermes session title |
| Root DM behavior | Normal chat (lobby if `ignore_root_dm: true`) | Becomes a system lobby (non-command messages are rejected) |
| Primary use case | Permanent workspaces with optional skill binding | Ad-hoc parallel sessions |
| Persistence | `extra.dm_topics` in config | `telegram_dm_topic_mode` + `telegram_dm_topic_bindings` SQLite tables |

Both features can coexist on the same bot — you'd run `/topic` from a user's DM, and `extra.dm_topics` continues to manage operator-declared topics for other chats.

### Prerequisites

In **@BotFather**, open your bot → **Bot Settings → Threads Settings**:

1. Turn on **Threaded Mode** (enables `has_topics_enabled`)
2. Do **not** disable users creating topics (keeps `allows_users_to_create_topics` on)

When the user first runs `/topic`, Hermes calls `getMe` to verify both flags. If either is off, Hermes sends a screenshot of the BotFather Threads Settings page and explains what to toggle — no activation happens until prerequisites are met.

### Activation flow

From the root DM, send:

```
/topic
```

Hermes will:

1. Check `getMe().has_topics_enabled` and `allows_users_to_create_topics`
2. If both are true, enable multi-session topic mode for this DM
3. Create and pin a **System** topic for status/commands (best-effort)
4. Reply with a list of previous unlinked Telegram sessions the user can restore

After activation, the **root DM is a lobby**: normal prompts are rejected with guidance pointing at **All Messages**. System commands (`/status`, `/sessions`, `/usage`, `/help`, etc.) still work in the root.

### Creating a new topic (end-user flow)

1. Open the bot DM in Telegram
2. Tap **All Messages** at the top of the bot interface, then send any message
3. Telegram creates a new topic for that message
4. Hermes responds inside that topic — the topic is now a standalone session

Every topic gets its own conversation history, model state, tool execution, and session ID. The isolation key is `agent:main:telegram:dm:{chat_id}:{thread_id}` — identical to the config-driven DM topics isolation.

### Auto-renamed topics

When Hermes generates a session title for a topic (via the auto-title pipeline, after the first exchange), the Telegram topic itself is renamed to match — e.g. "New Topic" becomes "Database migration plan". The rename is best-effort: failures are logged but don't break the session.

To disable this and keep your manually-chosen topic names untouched, set:

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      extra:
        disable_topic_auto_rename: true
```

When this flag is on, Hermes still generates an internal session title (used by `hermes sessions`, the TUI, etc.) but never edits the Telegram topic name. Useful when you organise topics by hand under BotFather Threaded Mode and don't want every first reply to overwrite the title.

### `/new` inside a topic

Resets the current topic's session (new session ID, fresh history) without touching other topics. Hermes replies with a reminder that for parallel work, creating another topic (via **All Messages**) is usually what you want.

### Restoring a previous session

Inside a topic, send:

```
/topic <session-id>
```

This binds the current topic to an existing Hermes session instead of starting fresh. Useful for continuing a conversation that started before topic mode was enabled. Restrictions:

- The target session must belong to the same Telegram user
- The target session must not already be bound to another topic

Hermes confirms with the session title and replays the last assistant message for context.

To discover session IDs, send `/topic` (no argument) in the root DM — Hermes lists the user's unlinked Telegram sessions.

### `/topic` inside a topic (no argument)

Shows the current topic's binding: session title, session ID, and hints for `/new` vs creating another topic.

### Under the hood

- Activation persists to `telegram_dm_topic_mode(chat_id, user_id, enabled, ...)` in `state.db`
- Each topic binding persists to `telegram_dm_topic_bindings(chat_id, thread_id, session_id, ...)` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `session_id` — pruning a session automatically clears its topic binding
- The topic-mode SQLite migration is **opt-in**: it runs on the first `/topic` call, never on gateway startup. Until a user runs `/topic` in this profile, `state.db` is unchanged
- Each inbound DM message looks up its `(chat_id, thread_id)` binding. If present, the lookup routes the message to the bound session via `SessionStore.switch_session()` so the session-key-to-session-id mapping stays consistent on disk
- `/new` inside a topic rewrites the binding row to point at the new session ID, so the next message stays on the fresh session
- Topics declared in `extra.dm_topics` are **never auto-renamed** — the operator-chosen name is preserved even when multi-session mode is enabled
- Set `extra.disable_topic_auto_rename: true` to turn off auto-rename for **all** topics in the chat (ad-hoc topics created via Threaded Mode included)
- The General (pinned top) topic in a forum-enabled DM is treated as the root lobby, regardless of whether Telegram delivers its messages with `message_thread_id=1` or with no thread_id
- Root-lobby reminders are rate-limited to one message per 30 seconds per chat — a user who forgets topic mode is on and types ten prompts in the root won't get ten replies
- BotFather setup screenshots are rate-limited to one send per 5 minutes per chat — repeated `/topic` attempts while Threads Settings are still disabled won't re-upload the same image
- `/background <prompt>` started inside a topic delivers its result back to the same topic; background sessions don't trigger auto-rename of the owning topic
- `/topic` itself is gated by the bot's user authorization check — unauthorized DMs get a refusal instead of activation

### Disabling multi-session mode

Send `/topic off` in the root DM. Hermes flips the row off, clears the chat's `(thread_id → session_id)` bindings, and the root DM reverts to a normal Hermes chat. Existing topics in Telegram aren't deleted — they just stop being gated as independent sessions. Re-run `/topic` later to turn it back on.

If you need to clean up by hand (e.g. a bulk reset across many chats), remove the rows directly:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.hermes/state.db \
  "UPDATE telegram_dm_topic_mode SET enabled = 0 WHERE chat_id = '<your_chat_id>'; \
   DELETE FROM telegram_dm_topic_bindings WHERE chat_id = '<your_chat_id>';"
```

### Downgrading Hermes

If you downgrade to a Hermes version that predates `/topic`, the feature simply stops working — the `telegram_dm_topic_mode` and `telegram_dm_topic_bindings` tables remain in `state.db` but are ignored by older code. DMs revert to the native per-thread isolation (each `message_thread_id` still gets its own session via `build_session_key`), so your existing Telegram topics keep working as parallel sessions. The root DM is no longer a lobby — messages there go into the agent like they used to. Re-upgrading reactivates multi-session mode exactly where it was.

## Group Forum Topic Skill Binding

Supergroups with **Topics mode** enabled (also called "forum topics") already get session isolation per topic — each `thread_id` maps to its own conversation. But you may want to **auto-load a skill** when messages arrive in a specific group topic, just like DM topic skill binding works.

### Use case

A team supergroup with forum topics for different workstreams:

- **Engineering** topic → auto-loads the `software-development` skill
- **Research** topic → auto-loads the `arxiv` skill
- **General** topic → no skill, general-purpose assistant

### Configuration

Add topic bindings under `platforms.telegram.extra.group_topics` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  telegram:
    extra:
      group_topics:
      - chat_id: -1001234567890       # Supergroup ID
        topics:
        - name: Engineering
          thread_id: 5
          skill: software-development
        - name: Research
          thread_id: 12
          skill: arxiv
        - name: General
          thread_id: 1
          # No skill — general purpose
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `chat_id` | Yes | The supergroup's numeric ID (negative number starting with `-100`) |
| `name` | No | Human-readable label for the topic (informational only) |
| `thread_id` | Yes | Telegram forum topic ID — visible in `t.me/c/<group_id>/<thread_id>` links |
| `skill` | No | Skill to auto-load on new sessions in this topic |

### How it works

1. When a message arrives in a mapped group topic, Hermes looks up the `chat_id` and `thread_id` in `group_topics` config
2. If a matching entry has a `skill` field, that skill is auto-loaded for the session — identical to DM topic skill binding
3. Topics without a `skill` key get session isolation only (existing behavior, unchanged)
4. Unmapped `thread_id` values or `chat_id` values fall through silently — no error, no skill

### Differences from DM Topics

| | DM Topics | Group Topics |
|---|---|---|
| Config key | `extra.dm_topics` | `extra.group_topics` |
| Topic creation | Hermes creates topics via API if `thread_id` is missing | Admin creates topics in Telegram UI |
| `thread_id` | Auto-populated after creation | Must be set manually |
| `icon_color` / `icon_custom_emoji_id` | Supported | Not applicable (admin controls appearance) |
| Skill binding | ✓ | ✓ |
| Session isolation | ✓ | ✓ (already built-in for forum topics) |

:::tip
To find a topic's `thread_id`, open the topic in Telegram Web or Desktop and look at the URL: `https://t.me/c/1234567890/5` — the last number (`5`) is the `thread_id`. The `chat_id` for supergroups is the group ID prefixed with `-100` (e.g., group `1234567890` becomes `-1001234567890`).

## Recent Bot API Features

- **Bot API 9.4 (Feb 2026):** Private Chat Topics — bots can create forum topics in 1-on-1 DM chats via `createForumTopic`. Hermes uses this for two distinct features: operator-curated [Private Chat Topics](#private-chat-topics-bot-api-94) (config-driven, fixed topic list) and user-driven [Multi-session DM mode](#multi-session-dm-mode-topic) (activated by `/topic`, unlimited user-created topics).
- **Privacy policy:** Telegram now requires bots to have a privacy policy. Set one via BotFather with `/setprivacy_policy`, or Telegram may auto-generate a placeholder. This is particularly important if your bot is public-facing.
- **Bot API 9.5 (Mar 2026): Native streaming via `sendMessageDraft`.** Hermes supports Telegram's native streaming-draft API as an opt-in transport for private chats. The default remains the legacy `editMessageText` path because draft previews can visibly collapse and re-render on some Telegram clients.

### Streaming transport (`gateway.streaming.transport`)

When streaming is enabled (`gateway.streaming.enabled: true`), Hermes picks one of four transports:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Native draft streaming on supported chats (currently Telegram DMs); legacy edit-based path otherwise. Falls back gracefully if a draft frame fails. |
| `draft` | Force native drafts. Logs a downgrade and falls back to edit if the chat doesn't support drafts (e.g. groups/topics). |
| `edit` | Legacy progressive `editMessageText` polling for every chat type. |
| `off` | Disable streaming entirely (final reply only, no progressive updates). |

In `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
gateway:
  streaming:
    enabled: true
    transport: auto    # auto | draft | edit | off
```

**What you'll see in DMs with `edit` (default)** — the gateway sends a normal preview message and progressively updates it via `editMessageText`, avoiding Telegram's draft-preview collapse/rollback effect.

**What you'll see in DMs with `auto` or `draft`** — Telegram shows an animated draft preview that updates token-by-token. When the reply finishes, it's delivered as a regular message and the draft preview clears naturally on the client. Drafts have no message id, so the final answer is what stays in your chat history.

**What about groups, supergroups, forum topics?** Telegram restricts `sendMessageDraft` to private chats (DMs). The gateway transparently falls back to the edit-based path for everything else — same UX as before.

**What if a draft frame fails?** Any failure (transient network error, server-side rejection, older python-telegram-bot install) flips that response back to the edit-based path for the rest of the stream. The next response gets a fresh attempt.

## Rendering: Rich Messages, Tables and Link Previews

**Rich Messages (Bot API 10.1).** Final replies that contain constructs the legacy MarkdownV2 path degrades — tables, task lists, collapsible `<details>`, and block math — are sent with Telegram's native [`sendRichMessage`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendrichmessage) using the agent's **raw markdown**, so they render natively with no client-side flattening. During streaming, the final answer is delivered by **editing the existing preview in place** via `editMessageText`'s `rich_message` parameter — no second message, no delete, so there is no duplicate-delivery flicker at the end of a turn. In DMs the live streaming preview also uses `sendRichMessageDraft`, so the animated draft matches the final rich message. Ordinary replies (plain prose, bold/italic, simple lists) stay on the MarkdownV2 path for consistent font weight and spacing across clients.

The rich path is skipped automatically when content exceeds the 32,768-character rich text limit, and any rejection from Telegram (unsupported endpoint on an older `python-telegram-bot`, parser error, oversized blocks/columns) **transparently falls back** to the MarkdownV2 path — your message is never lost. Transient/network errors are *not* silently re-sent (no duplicate final message).

**MarkdownV2 fallback.** When the rich path is unavailable for a message, Hermes converts markdown to MarkdownV2. Since MarkdownV2 has no native table syntax, pipe tables are normalized:

- **Small tables** are flattened into **row-group bullets** — each row becomes a readable bulleted list under the column headings. Good for 2–4 columns and short cells.
- **Larger or wider tables** fall back to a **fenced code block** with aligned columns so nothing collapses.

Rich messages are **opt-in**. The default stays on the legacy MarkdownV2 path because current Telegram clients can make Bot API rich messages difficult to copy as plain text, which is especially painful for command snippets and mobile handoffs. To enable native rendering for tables/task lists/details/math:

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      extra:
        rich_messages: true
```

This setting is for client-rendering/copy compatibility; Hermes already falls back automatically when Telegram rejects the rich API call. If you only want the legacy "always code-block" table behavior while keeping rich messages enabled, disable table normalization by setting `telegram.pretty_tables: false` in `config.yaml` (default: `true`).

**Link previews.** Telegram auto-generates link previews for URLs in bot messages. If you'd rather suppress those (long `/tools` output, agent reply that mentions ten links, etc.):

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      extra:
        disable_link_previews: true
```

When enabled, Hermes attaches Telegram's `LinkPreviewOptions(is_disabled=True)` to every outgoing message and falls back to the legacy `disable_web_page_preview` parameter on older `python-telegram-bot` versions.

## Group Allowlisting

Telegram groups and forum chats have two orthogonal gates you can configure:

- **Sender user IDs** (`group_allow_from` / `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS`) — sender-scoped allowlist that applies only to group/forum messages. Use this when you want specific users to be able to invoke the bot in groups without adding them to `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` (which would also give them DM access).
- **Chat IDs** (`group_allowed_chats` / `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS`) — chat-scoped allowlist. Any member of these groups/forums can interact with the bot. Useful for team/support bots where group membership itself is the access signal.

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      extra:
        # Global access (DMs + groups). Users here can always invoke the bot.
        allow_from:
          - "123456789"
        # Sender IDs allowed in groups/forums only. Does NOT grant DM access.
        group_allow_from:
          - "987654321"
        # Entire groups/forums — any member is authorized.
        group_allowed_chats:
          - "-1001234567890"
```

Equivalent env vars:

```bash
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS="123456789"
TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS="987654321"
TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS="-1001234567890"
```

Behavior:

- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` covers all chat types (DMs, groups, forums).
- `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS` only authorizes the listed senders in groups/forums. They still can't DM the bot unless listed in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`.
- A chat in `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS` authorizes every member of that chat, regardless of sender.
- Use `*` in any of these to allow any sender/chat.
- This layers on top of existing mention/pattern triggers and on top of `group_topics` + `ignored_threads`.

### Migration from before PR #17686

Prior to this split, `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS` was the only knob and users put **chat IDs** in it. For backward compatibility, chat-ID-shaped values (starting with `-`) in `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS` are still honored as chat IDs and a deprecation warning is logged once. Migration:

```bash
# Old (still works, but deprecated)
TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS="-1001234567890"

# New
TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS="-1001234567890"
```

### Guest @mention bypass (`guest_mode`)

In a typical setup, `group_allowed_chats` is a hard gate: messages from groups outside the list are silently dropped, even if a member explicitly @mentions the bot. That's the right default for support / team bots.

For more casual setups — friend group chats where you want the bot **mostly silent** but **occasionally available on explicit ping** — enable `guest_mode`:

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      extra:
        group_allowed_chats:
          - "-1001234567890"   # your main allowlisted group
        guest_mode: true       # non-allowlisted groups: allow on @mention only
```

Env equivalent:

```bash
TELEGRAM_GUEST_MODE=true
```

Default: `false`.

With `guest_mode: true`, a message from a non-allowlisted group is processed **only** if it explicitly @mentions the bot. The mention is required every turn — there's no session stickiness for guest interactions, so the bot never auto-engages in a friend group thread it isn't pinged into.

DMs and allowlisted groups behave exactly as before.

## Slash Command Access Control

By default, every allowed user can run every slash command. To split your allowlist into **admins** (full slash command access) and **regular users** (only commands you explicitly enable), add `allow_admin_from` and `user_allowed_commands` to the platform's `extra` block:

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      extra:
        # Existing allowlists (unchanged)
        allow_from:
          - "123456789"     # admin
          - "555555555"     # regular user
          - "777777777"     # regular user

        # NEW — admins get all slash commands (built-in + plugin)
        allow_admin_from:
          - "123456789"

        # NEW — non-admin allowed users can only run these slash commands.
        # /help and /whoami are always allowed so users can see their access.
        user_allowed_commands:
          - status
          - model
          - history

        # Optional: separate admin/command lists for groups
        group_allow_admin_from:
          - "123456789"
        group_user_allowed_commands:
          - status
```

**Behavior:**

- A user listed in `allow_admin_from` for a scope (DM or group) can run **every** registered slash command — built-in commands AND plugin-registered ones — through the live registry.
- A user in `allow_from` but **not** in `allow_admin_from` can only run commands listed in `user_allowed_commands`, plus the always-allowed floor: `/help` and `/whoami`.
- Plain chat (non-slash messages) is unaffected. Non-admin users can still talk to the agent normally, they just can't trigger arbitrary commands.
- **Backward compat:** if `allow_admin_from` is not set for a scope, slash command gating is disabled for that scope. Existing installs keep working with no changes.
- DM admin status does not imply group admin status. Each scope has its own admin list.
- If only `group_allow_admin_from` is set, DM scope stays in unrestricted (backward-compat) mode.

Use `/whoami` to see the active scope, your tier (admin / user / unrestricted), and which slash commands you can run.

## Interactive Model Picker

When you send `/model` with no arguments in a Telegram chat, Hermes shows an interactive inline keyboard for switching models:

1. **Provider selection** — buttons showing each available provider with model counts (e.g., "OpenAI (15)", "✓ Anthropic (12)" for the current provider).
2. **Model selection** — paginated model list with **Prev**/**Next** navigation, a **Back** button to return to providers, and **Cancel**.

The current model and provider are displayed at the top. All navigation happens by editing the same message in-place (no chat clutter).

:::tip
If you know the exact model name, type `/model <name>` directly to skip the picker. You can also type `/model <name> --global` to persist the change across sessions.

## DNS-over-HTTPS Fallback IPs

In some restricted networks, `api.telegram.org` may resolve to an IP that is unreachable. The Telegram adapter includes a **fallback IP** mechanism that transparently retries connections against alternative IPs while preserving the correct TLS hostname and SNI.

### How it works

1. If `TELEGRAM_FALLBACK_IPS` is set, those IPs are used directly.
2. Otherwise, the adapter automatically queries **Google DNS** and **Cloudflare DNS** via DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to discover alternative IPs for `api.telegram.org`.
3. IPs returned by DoH that differ from the system DNS result are used as fallbacks.
4. If DoH is also blocked, a hardcoded seed IP (`149.154.167.220`) is used as a last resort.
5. Once a fallback IP succeeds, it becomes "sticky" — subsequent requests use it directly without retrying the primary path first.

### Configuration

```bash
# Explicit fallback IPs (comma-separated)
TELEGRAM_FALLBACK_IPS=149.154.167.220,149.154.167.221
```

Or in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  telegram:
    extra:
      fallback_ips:
        - "149.154.167.220"
```

:::tip
You usually don't need to configure this manually. The auto-discovery via DoH handles most restricted-network scenarios. The `TELEGRAM_FALLBACK_IPS` env var is only needed if DoH is also blocked on your network.
:::

## Proxy Support

If your network requires an HTTP proxy to reach the internet (common in corporate environments), the Telegram adapter automatically reads standard proxy environment variables and routes all connections through the proxy.

### Supported variables

The adapter checks these environment variables in order, using the first one that is set:

1. `HTTPS_PROXY`
2. `HTTP_PROXY`
3. `ALL_PROXY`
4. `https_proxy` / `http_proxy` / `all_proxy` (lowercase variants)

### Configuration

Set the proxy in your environment before starting the gateway:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
hermes gateway
```

Or add it to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

The proxy applies to both the primary transport and all fallback IP transports. No additional Hermes configuration is needed — if the environment variable is set, it's used automatically.

:::note
This covers the custom fallback transport layer that Hermes uses for Telegram connections. The standard `httpx` client used elsewhere already respects proxy env vars natively.

## Message Reactions

The bot can add emoji reactions to messages as visual processing feedback:

- 👀 when the bot starts processing your message
- ✅ when the response is delivered successfully
- ❌ if an error occurs during processing

Reactions are **disabled by default**. Enable them in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
telegram:
  reactions: true
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
TELEGRAM_REACTIONS=true
```

:::note
Unlike Discord (where reactions are additive), Telegram's Bot API replaces all bot reactions in a single call. The transition from 👀 to ✅/❌ happens atomically — you won't see both at once.
:::

:::tip
If the bot doesn't have permission to add reactions in a group, the reaction calls fail silently and message processing continues normally.

## Per-Channel Prompts

Assign ephemeral system prompts to specific Telegram groups or forum topics. The prompt is injected at runtime on every turn — never persisted to transcript history — so changes take effect immediately.

```yaml
telegram:
  channel_prompts:
    "-1001234567890": |
      You are a research assistant. Focus on academic sources,
      citations, and concise synthesis.
    "42":  |
      This topic is for creative writing feedback. Be warm and
      constructive.
```

Keys are chat IDs (groups/supergroups) or forum topic IDs. For forum groups, topic-level prompts override the group-level prompt:

- Message in topic `42` inside group `-1001234567890` → uses topic `42`'s prompt
- Message in topic `99` (no explicit entry) → falls back to group `-1001234567890`'s prompt
- Message in a group with no entry → no channel prompt applied

Numeric YAML keys are automatically normalized to strings.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bot not responding at all | Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct. Check `hermes gateway` logs for errors. |
| Bot responds with "unauthorized" | Your user ID is not in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`. Double-check with @userinfobot. |
| Bot ignores group messages | Privacy mode is likely on. Disable it (Step 3) or make the bot a group admin. **Remember to remove and re-add the bot after changing privacy.** |
| Voice messages not transcribed | Verify STT is available: install `faster-whisper` for local transcription, or set `GROQ_API_KEY` / `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` in `~/.hermes/.env`. |
| Voice replies are files, not bubbles | Install `ffmpeg` (needed for Edge TTS Opus conversion). |
| Bot token revoked/invalid | Generate a new token via `/revoke` then `/newbot` or `/token` in BotFather. Update your `.env` file. |
| Webhook not receiving updates | Verify `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` is publicly reachable (test with `curl`). Ensure your platform/reverse proxy routes inbound HTTPS traffic from the URL's port to the local listen port configured by `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT` (they do not need to be the same number). Ensure SSL/TLS is active — Telegram only sends to HTTPS URLs. Check firewall rules. |

## Exec Approval

When the agent tries to run a potentially dangerous command, it asks you for approval in the chat:

> ⚠️ This command is potentially dangerous (recursive delete). Reply "yes" to approve.

Reply "yes"/"y" to approve or "no"/"n" to deny.

## Interactive Prompts (clarify)

When the agent calls the `clarify` tool — to ask which approach you prefer, get post-task feedback, or check before a non-trivial decision — Telegram renders the question with **inline keyboard buttons**:

> ❓ Which framework should I use for the dashboard?
>
> [1. Next.js] [2. Remix] [3. Astro]
> [✏️ Other (type answer)]

Tap a button to answer, or tap **Other** to type a free-form response (the next message you send becomes the answer). Open-ended `clarify` calls (no preset choices) skip the buttons and just capture your next message.

Configure the response timeout via `agent.clarify_timeout` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (default `600` seconds). If you don't respond within the timeout, the agent unblocks with a sentinel message and adapts rather than hanging.

## Push notification volume

Telegram fires a push notification on every message the bot sends. For long agent turns that emit tool-progress bubbles, streaming updates, and status callbacks, this gets noisy fast. The Telegram adapter has two notification modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `important` (default) | Only **final responses**, **approval prompts**, and **slash-command confirmations** ring. Tool progress, streaming chunks, and status messages are delivered with `disable_notification=true`. |
| `all` | Every outgoing message fires a push notification. Legacy behavior; opt in if you genuinely want to hear about every tool call. |

Configure in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
display:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      notifications: important   # or "all"
```

Env override (handy for quick A/B testing):

```bash
HERMES_TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS=all
```

Unknown values log a warning and fall back to `important`.

## Status messages edited in place

The Telegram adapter routes recurring agent status callbacks (e.g. "Compressing context…", "Calling tool…") through `send_or_update_status()`, which keeps a `{(chat_id, status_key) → message_id}` cache and **edits the existing bubble** on subsequent emits instead of appending a new one each time. Distinct `status_key` values get their own messages; distinct chats never collide. If the edit fails (e.g. the user deleted the message, or it's older than Telegram allows for edits), the cache entry is dropped and the next emit posts a fresh message and re-caches its ID. No config required — this is the default Telegram behavior. Other adapters that don't implement `send_or_update_status` fall through to plain `send()` unchanged.

## Pin incoming user message during agent turn

When a user sends a message that triggers an agent turn, the Telegram adapter pins that incoming message for the duration of the turn and unpins it when the response is finished — a lightweight visual indicator that the bot is actively working on the message rather than ignoring it. The pin uses `disable_notification=true` to avoid extra pings. No config required.

## Security

:::warning
Always set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` to restrict who can interact with your bot. Without it, the gateway denies all users by default as a safety measure.
:::

Never share your bot token publicly. If compromised, revoke it immediately via BotFather's `/revoke` command.

For more details, see the [Security documentation](/user-guide/security). You can also use [DM pairing](/user-guide/messaging#dm-pairing-alternative-to-allowlists) for a more dynamic approach to user authorization.
