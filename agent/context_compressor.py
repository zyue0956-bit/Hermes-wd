"""Automatic context window compression for long conversations.

Self-contained class with its own OpenAI client for summarization.
Uses auxiliary model (cheap/fast) to summarize middle turns while
protecting head and tail context.

Improvements over v2:
  - Structured summary template with Resolved/Pending question tracking
  - Filter-safe summarizer preamble that treats prior turns as source material
  - Historical (reference-only) section headings replace "Next Steps"/"Remaining Work" to avoid reading as active instructions
  - Clear separator when summary merges into tail message
  - Iterative summary updates (preserves info across multiple compactions)
  - Token-budget tail protection instead of fixed message count
  - Tool output pruning before LLM summarization (cheap pre-pass)
  - Scaled summary budget (proportional to compressed content)
  - Richer tool call/result detail in summarizer input

Recovered from a deterministic fallback because the LLM context summarizer was unavailable. Continue from the protected recent messages after this summary and use current file/system state for exact details.{previous_summary_note}

## Constraints & Preferences
- This fallback was generated locally without an LLM summary call.
- Secrets and credentials were redacted before preservation.
- The summary may be incomplete; prefer verifying current files, git state, processes, and test results instead of assuming omitted details.

[THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FIELD. Capture the user's most recent unfulfilled
input verbatim — the exact words they used. This includes:
- Explicit task assignments ("refactor the auth module")
- Questions awaiting an answer ("waarom staat X op Y?", "wat zijn de volgende stappen?")
- Decisions awaiting input ("optie A of B?")
- Ongoing discussions where the assistant owes the next substantive reply
A conversation where the user just asked a question IS an active task — the
task is "answer that question with full context". Do NOT write "None" merely
because the user did not issue an imperative command; reserve "None" for the
rare case where the last exchange was fully resolved and the user said
something like "thanks, that's all".
If multiple items are outstanding, list only the ones NOT yet completed.
Continuation should pick up exactly here. Examples:
"User asked: 'Now refactor the auth module to use JWT instead of sessions'"
"User asked: 'Waarom stond provider ineens op openrouter?' — needs investigation + answer"
"User chose option A; awaiting implementation of step 2"
If the user's most recent message was a reverse signal (stop, undo, roll
back, never mind, just verify, change of topic) that supersedes earlier
work, write the reverse signal verbatim and DO NOT carry forward the
cancelled task. Example: "User asked: 'Stop the i18n refactor and just
verify the current diff' — earlier i18n in-flight work is cancelled."
If no outstanding task exists, write "None."]

1. READ config.py:45 — found `==` should be `!=` [tool: read_file]
2. PATCH config.py:45 — changed `==` to `!=` [tool: patch]
