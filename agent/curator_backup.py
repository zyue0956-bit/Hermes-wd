"""Curator snapshot + rollback.

A pre-run snapshot of ``~/.hermes/skills/`` (excluding ``.curator_backups/``
itself) is taken before any mutating curator pass. Snapshots are tar.gz
files under ``~/.hermes/skills/.curator_backups/<utc-iso>/`` with a
companion ``manifest.json`` describing the snapshot (reason, time, size,
counted skill files). Rollback picks a snapshot, moves the current
``skills/`` tree aside into another snapshot so even the rollback itself
is undoable, then extracts the chosen snapshot into place.

The snapshot does NOT include:
  - ``.curator_backups/`` (would recurse)
  - ``.hub/`` (hub-installed skills — managed by the hub, not us)

It DOES include:
  - all SKILL.md files + their directories (``scripts/``, ``references/``,
    ``templates/``, ``assets/``)
  - ``.usage.json`` (usage telemetry — needed to rehydrate state cleanly)
  - ``.archive/`` (so rollback restores previously-archived skills too)
  - ``.curator_state`` (so rolling back also restores the last-run-at
    pointer — otherwise the curator would immediately re-fire on the next
    tick)
  - ``.bundled_manifest`` (so protection markers stay consistent)
  - ``.curator_suppressed`` (so rollback restores the set of pruned built-ins
    the re-seeder must leave archived)

Alongside the skills tarball, each snapshot also captures a copy of
``~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`` as ``cron-jobs.json`` when it exists. Cron
jobs reference skills by name in their ``skills``/``skill`` fields; the
curator's consolidation pass rewrites those in place via
``cron.jobs.rewrite_skill_refs()``. Without capturing the pre-run state,
rolling back the skills tree would leave cron jobs pointing at the
umbrella skills even though the narrow skills they were originally
configured with have been restored. We store the whole jobs.json for
fidelity but rollback only touches the ``skills``/``skill`` fields — the
rest (schedule, next_run_at, enabled, prompt, etc.) is live state and
we leave it alone.
