"""Shared helpers for canonicalising WhatsApp sender identity.

WhatsApp's bridge can surface the same human under two different JID shapes
within a single conversation:

- LID form: ``999999999999999@lid``
- Phone form: ``15551234567@s.whatsapp.net``

Both the authorisation path (:mod:`gateway.run`) and the session-key path
(:mod:`gateway.session`) need to collapse these aliases to a single stable
identity. This module is the single source of truth for that resolution so
the two paths can never drift apart.

Public helpers:

- :func:`normalize_whatsapp_identifier` — strip JID/LID/device/plus syntax
  down to the bare numeric identifier.
- :func:`canonical_whatsapp_identifier` — walk the bridge's
  ``lid-mapping-*.json`` files and return a stable canonical identity
  across phone/LID variants.
- :func:`expand_whatsapp_aliases` — return the full alias set for an
  identifier. Used by authorisation code that needs to match any known
  form of a sender against an allow-list.

Plugins that need per-sender behaviour on WhatsApp (role-based routing,
per-contact authorisation, policy gating in a gateway hook) should use
``canonical_whatsapp_identifier`` so their bookkeeping lines up with
Hermes' own session keys.
