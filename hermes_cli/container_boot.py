"""Container-boot reconciliation of per-profile gateway s6 services.

Service directories under /run/service/ live on **tmpfs** and are wiped
on every container restart. Profile directories under
``$HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>/`` live on the persistent VOLUME, and
each one records its gateway's last state in ``gateway_state.json``.
This module bridges the two: on every container boot, walk the
persistent profiles, recreate the s6 service slots, and auto-start
only those whose last recorded state was ``running``.

Wired into the image as /etc/cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles by the
Dockerfile (Phase 4 Task 4.0). Runs as root after 01-hermes-setup
(the stage2 hook) has chowned the volume and seeded $HERMES_HOME, but
before s6-rc starts user services.

Without this module, every ``docker restart`` would silently wipe
every per-profile gateway, even though the user's profiles still
exist on disk.
